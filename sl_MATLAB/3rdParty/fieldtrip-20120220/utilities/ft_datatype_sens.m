% FT_DATATYPE_SENS describes the FieldTrip structure that represents
% an EEG, ECoG, or MEG sensor array. This structure is commonly called
% "elec" for EEG and "grad" for MEG, or more general "sens" for either
% one.
%
% The structure for MEG gradiometers and/or magnetometers contains
%    sens.label    = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
%    sens.chanpos  = Mx3 matrix with channel positions
%    sens.chanori  = Mx3 matrix with channel orientations, used for synthetic planar gradient computation
%    sens.tra      = MxN matrix to combine coils into channels
%    sens.coilpos  = Nx3 matrix with coil positions
%    sens.coilori  = Nx3 matrix with coil orientations
%    sens.balance  = structure containing info about the balancing, See FT_APPLY_MONTAGE
%
% The structure for EEG or ECoG channels contains
%    sens.label    = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
%    sens.chanpos  = Mx3 matrix with channel positions
%    sens.tra      = MxN matrix to combine electrodes into channels
%    sens.elecpos  = Nx3 matrix with coil positions
% In case sens.tra is not present in the EEG sensor array, the channels
% are assumed to be average referenced.
%
% The following fields are optional
%    sens.type     = string with the MEG or EEG acquisition system, see FT_SENSTYPE
%    sens.chantype = Mx1 cell-array with the type of the channel, see FT_CHANTYPE
%    sens.chanunit = Mx1 cell-array with the units of the channel signal, e.g. 'T', 'fT' or 'fT/cm'
%
% Revision history:
%
% (2011v2/latest) The chantype and chanunit have been added for MEG.
%
% (2011v1) To facilitate determining the position of channels (e.g. for plotting)
%  in case of balanced MEG or bipolar EEG, an explicit distinction has been made
%  between chanpos+chanori and coilpos+coilori (for MEG) and chanpos and elecpos
%  (for EEG). The pnt and ori fields are removed
%
% (2010) Added support for bipolar or otherwise more complex linear combinations
%  of EEG electrodes using sens.tra, similar to MEG.
%
% (2009) Noice reduction has been added for MEG systems in the balance field.
%
% (2006) The optional fields sens.type and sens.unit were added.
%
% (2003) The initial version was defined, which looked like this for EEG
%    sens.pnt     = Mx3 matrix with electrode positions
%    sens.label   = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
% and like this for MEG
%    sens.pnt     = Nx3 matrix with coil positions
%    sens.ori     = Nx3 matrix with coil orientations
%    sens.tra     = MxN matrix to combine coils into channels
%    sens.label   = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
