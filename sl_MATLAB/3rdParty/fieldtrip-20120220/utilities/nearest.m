function [indx] = nearest(array, val, insideflag, toleranceflag)

% NEAREST return the index of an array nearest to a scalar
%
% Use as
%   [indx] = nearest(array, val, insideflag, toleranceflag)
%
% If not specified or if left empty, the insideflag and the toleranceflag
% will default to false.
%
% The boolean insideflag can be used to specify whether the value should be
% within the array or not. For example nearest(1:10, -inf) will return 1,
% but nearest(1:10, -inf, true) will return an error because -inf is not
% within the array.
%
% The boolean toleranceflag is used when insideflag is true. It can be used
% to specify whether some tolerance should be allowed for values that are
% just outside the array. For example nearest(1:10, 0.99, true, false) will
% return an error, but nearest(1:10, 0.99, true, true) will return 1. The
% tolerance that is allowed is half the distance between the subsequent
% values in the array.
