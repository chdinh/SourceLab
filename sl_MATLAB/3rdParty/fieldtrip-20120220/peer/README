The FieldTrip peer toolbox implements peer-to-peer distributed
computing using MATLAB without the need for a centralized server/manager.

The FieldTrip project is an initiative of the Donders Institute for
Brain, Cognition and Behaviour. Together with collaborating institutes,
we are developing and implementing methods for the analysis of MEG
and EEG data.
