function ft_realtime_average(cfg)

% FT_REALTIME_AVERAGE is an example realtime application for online
% averaging of the data. It should work both for EEG and MEG.
%
% Use as
%   ft_realtime_average(cfg)
% with the following configuration options
%   cfg.channel    = cell-array, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION (default = 'all')
%   cfg.trialfun   = string with the trial function
%
% The source of the data is configured as
%   cfg.dataset       = string
% or alternatively to obtain more low-level control as
%   cfg.datafile      = string
%   cfg.headerfile    = string
%   cfg.eventfile     = string
%   cfg.dataformat    = string, default is determined automatic
%   cfg.headerformat  = string, default is determined automatic
%   cfg.eventformat   = string, default is determined automatic
%
% To stop the realtime function, you have to press Ctrl-C
