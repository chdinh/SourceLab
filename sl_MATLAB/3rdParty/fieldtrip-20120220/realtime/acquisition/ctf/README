This directory contains some code that assists in accessing the CTF
shared memory buffer from within Matlab. You should compile this
code on your CTF MEG acquisition computer and start it prior to
starting Acq. The AcqBuffer command line application maintains the
shared memory.  It keeps as many data records in memory, but alsways
ensures that there are enough empty data records for Acq to write
new data towards.

This code is to be used in conjunction with the read_header,
read_data and read_event function in the FieldTrip fileio module
and specifically for the "ctf_shm" file format.
