function [c,Ls]=wmdct(f,g,M,L)
%WMDCT  Windowed MDCT transform.
%   Usage:  c=wmdct(f,g,M);
%           c=wmdct(f,g,M,L);
%           [c,Ls]=wmdct(f,g,M);
%           [c,Ls]=wmdct(f,g,M,L);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input data
%         g     : Window function.
%         M     : Number of bands.
%         L     : Length of transform to do.
%   Output parameters:
%         c     : 2*M x N array of coefficients.
%         Ls    : Length of input signal.
%
%   WMDCT(f,g,M) computes a Windowed Modified Discrete Cosine Transform with
%   M bands and window g.
%
%   The length of the transform will be the smallest possible that is
%   larger than the signal. f will be zero-extended to the length of the 
%   transform. If f is a matrix, the transformation is applied to each column.
%   g must be whole-point even.
%
%   The window g may be a vector of numerical values, a text string or a
%   cell array. See the help of WILWIN for more details.
%
%   WMDCT(f,g,M,L) computes the MDCT transform as above, but does
%   a transform of length L. f will be cut or zero-extended to length L
%   before the transform is done.
%
%   [c,Ls]=WMDCT(f,g,M) or [c,Ls]=WMDCT(f,g,M,L) additionally return the
%   length of the input signal f. This is handy for reconstruction:
%
%            [c,Ls]=wmdct(f,g,M);
%            fr=iwmdct(c,gd,M,Ls);
%
%   will reconstuct the signal f no matter what the length of f is, provided
%   that gd is a dual Wilson window of g.
%
%   The WMDCT is sometimes known as an odd-stacked cosine modulated filter
%   bank. The WMDCT defined by this routine is slightly different from the
%   most common definition of the WMDCT, in order to be able to use the
%   same window functions as the Wilson transform.
%
%   Assume that the following code has been executed for a column vector f
%   of length L:
%
%            c=wmdct(f,g,M);  % Compute the WMDCT of f.
%            N=size(c,2);    % Number of translation coefficients.
%
%   The following holds for m=0,...,M-1 
%   and n=0,...,N-1:
%
%   If m+n is even:
%
%                     L-1
%        c(m+1,n+1) = sum f(l+1)*cos(pi*(m+.5)*l/M+pi/4)*g(l-n*M+1)
%                     l=0
%
%   If m+n is odd:
%                     L-1
%        c(m+1,n+1) = sum f(l+1)*sin(pi*(m+.5)*l/M+pi/4)*g(l-n*M+1)
%                     l=0
