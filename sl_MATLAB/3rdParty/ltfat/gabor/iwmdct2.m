function [f]=iwmdct2(c,g1,p3,p4)
%IWMDCT2  2D Inverse windowed MDCT transform.
%   Usage: f=iwmdct2(c,g);
%          f=iwmdct2(c,g1,g2);
%          f=iwmdct2(c,g1,g2,Ls);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         c       : Array of coefficients.
%         g,g1,g2 : Window functions.
%         Ls      : Size of reconstructed signal.
%   Output parameters:
%         f       : Output data, matrix.
%
%   IWMDCT2(c,g) calculates a separable two dimensional inverse WMDCT
%   transform of the input coefficients c using the window g. The number of
%   channels is deduced from the size of the coefficients c.
%
%   IWMDCT2(c,g1,g2) does the same using the window g1 along the first
%   dimension, and window g2 the second dimension.
%
%   IWMDCT2(c,g1,g2,Ls) cuts the signal to size Ls after the transform is
%   done.
