function f=idft(f,N,dim)
%IDFT  Inverse DFT
%   Usage: f=idft(f);
%          f=idft(f,N,dim);
%
%   This function computes a normalized inverse discrete Fourier transform.
%   This is nothing but a scaled version of the output from IFFT. The
%   function takes exactly the same arguments as IFFT. See the help on IFFT
%   for a thorough description.
