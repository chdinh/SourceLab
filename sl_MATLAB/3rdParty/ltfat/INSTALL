--------- Running the toolbox --------------------

In Matlab or Octave type "ltfatstart" as the first command from the
installation directory. This will set up the correct paths.

If you issue the command "clear all" you will have to run ltfatstart
again.

In Octave you can put this command in your ~/.octaverc file. In Matlab
you can put this command in your startup.m file. You statup file of
choice should contain some lines like this:

addpath /path/to/ltfat
ltfatstart;

The ltfatstart command will add all the necessary subdirectories (so
please don't add these manually), and it will print a statement
telling you which backend you are currently using.

-------- Compiling the toolbox ------- ------------

- If you wish to use the toolbox with Matlab, see the file INSTALL-Matlab

- If you wish to use the toolbox with Octave, see the file INSTALL-Octave
