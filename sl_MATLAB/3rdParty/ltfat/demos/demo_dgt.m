%DEMO_DGT  Basic introduction to DGT analysis/synthesis
%
%   This demo shows how to compute Gabor coefficients of a signal.
%
%   FIGURE 1 Spectrogram of the 'bat' signal.
%
%     The figure shows a spectrogram of the 'bat' signal. The
%     coefficients is shown on a linear scale.
%
%   FIGURE 2 Gabor coefficients of the 'bat' signal.
%
%     The figure show a set of Gabor coefficients for the 'bat' signal,
%     computed using a DGT with a Gaussian window. The coefficients
%     contains all the information to reconstruct the signal, even though
%     there a far fewer coefficients than the spectrogram contains.
%
%   FIGURE 3 Real-valued Gabor analysis
%
%     This figure shows only the coefficients for the positive
%     frequencies. As the signal is real-value, these coefficients
%     contain all the necessary information. Compare to the shape of the
%     spectrogram shown on Figure 1.
%
%   FIGURE 4 DGT coefficients on a spectrogram
%
%     This figure shows how the coefficients from DGTREAL can be picked
%     from the coefficients computed by a full Short-time Fourier
%     transform, as visualized by a spectrogram.
