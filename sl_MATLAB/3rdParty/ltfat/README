To use the toolbox, 'cd' to this directory and execute 'ltfatstart'.

In Octave you can put this command in your ~/.octaverc file.

Directory struture.

The toolbox is organized in subdirectories as follows:

  fourier     - Fourier analysis, DCT/DST transforms and filters.
  gabor       - Gabor, Wilson and WMDCT analysis and synthesis functions.
  sparsereg   - Tools for sparse regression of Gabor and Wilson systems.
  sigproc     - A collection of simple, signal processing tools.
  demos       - Demos
  signals     - Test signals for use with the examples.
  comp        - Computational subroutines.
                These should not be called directly.
  src         - C implementation of the most computationally intensive
               routines.
  mex         - Mex files to speed up the toolbox (if compiled)
  oct         - Octave C++-files to speed up the toolbox (if compiled)

The file INSTALL contains instructions for compiling the C-library and 
the Octave and Matlab interfaces.
